Cybersecurity engineer with hands-on experience in vulnerability management, compliance automation, and cloud security. I specialize in building secure architectures, implementing DISA STIG and NIST controls, and leveraging automation with PowerShell and Python to streamline remediation. My projects showcase real-world security practices—from hardening systems in Azure to documenting compliance through SSPs and POA&Ms—demonstrating both technical depth and governance expertise.
